# Introduction

The key motivation for learning and using **R Markdown** is to avoid repetitive and error-prone tasks. More specifically, you should use R Markdown if you want to:

* concentrate on content rather than formatting
* share one document in many different formats (Markdown, PDF, Word, HTML)
* ensure correct citations and bibliographies
* switch between different citation formats
* integrate your data analysis automatically, not statically

This course module can only scratch the surface of the available features in *R Markdown* and aims to introduce a few key concepts and simple recipes. Consult the standard reference, *R Markdown: The Definitive Guide* [@XieAllaire_et_2022], to learn more. A useful resource for daily work with R Markdown is also the 'R Studio Cheatsheet' [Dynamic documents with rmarkdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/rmarkdown.pdf).

This document is a simple summary of the course module. Most importantly however it is created using R Markdown and is thus a self-documenting example. The source for this document can be found in this Github repository: <https://github.com/sdaume/r-course-module-3>


# Basic Markdown

*Markdown* is a type of *Markup* language; HTML is a well-known example for markup. In contrast to the latter *Markdown* is a light-weight and easily readable type of markup. If you have ever edited a Wikipedia page, you have come across one type of lightweight markup. Markdown is even easier. 

The following Figure \@ref(fig:markdown-editor) shows some common Markdown syntax and how this is interpreted (or rendered) in for example an HTML page. The figure is a screenshot of the [Atom](https://atom.io/) text editor which supports Markdown syntax and offers a preview of the interpreted Markdown. 

```{r markdown-editor, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="This is a screenshot of the Atom text editor showing some basic Markdown syntax and how it would be rendered."}

knitr::include_graphics('./images/markdown_basics.jpg')
```

A look at the table syntax shows however that even Markdown could get complicated. Most importantly, we might want our table content to be dynamically generated. This is where `R Markdown` shines and will help.


# R Markdown

* primary motivation is however to allow dynamic content

## Dynamic content

* integrate your analysis as code and generate the results dynamically with `knitr`


### Dynamic plots


### Dynamic tables


## Managing citations and bibliographies

### Using BibTeX


### Citing


### Changing styles
